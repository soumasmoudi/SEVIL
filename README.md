## SEVIL: Secure and Efficient VerifIcation over MuLtiple Proofs of Knowledge

This repository contains the proof-of-concept functionality of SEVIL, a secure and privacy-preserving scheme supporting batch verification of multiple group signatures. 
The reference paper of this solution will be available soon.

The POC of SEVIL relies in part on the implementation of Groth-Sahai proofs given [here](https://github.com/gijsvl/groth-sahai).
